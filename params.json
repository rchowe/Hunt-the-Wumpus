{"name":"Hunt-the-wumpus","body":"### How to play\r\nThis game is played in IRB; a launcher is included with the game, however it can also be played by simply `require`ing the file `wumpus.rb` in a running IRB session. Call `let_the_hunt_begin` to start the game, and follow the instructions, calling functions (cavern names) to move between caverns. If a cavern has blood on the walls, it implies that the wumpus is in a connected cavern. If a cavern has a breeze in it, there is a pit in a connected cavern. Once you have found the wumpus, call `shoot :cavern_description` to finally kill the wumpus! Each movement function returns a list of connected caverns for ease of writing programs to play the game.\r\n\r\n### Installation and Running\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/rchowe/Hunt-the-Wumpus.git\r\n    cd Hunt-the-Wumpus\r\n    bundle install\r\n    ./wumpus\r\n","tagline":"Hunt the Wumpus as a metaprogramming game in IRB","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
