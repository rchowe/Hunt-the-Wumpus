   
Hunt the Wumpus
===============

This is a hunt the wumpus clone with each of the caverns implemented as functions, dynamically defined based on which chamber you're in. Call an individual chamber's function to move to that chamber.

Once you have determined which chamber the wumpus is in, call the `shoot` function with the symbol of the chamber the wumpus is in.

The game is played in IRB.
